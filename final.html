                <br>This is my bird Two<br>
                <br> He likes crumpled paper and whistling along with me.
                <br> I wanted to create something fun that he could be a part of
                <br> and my bird basketball project was the final pick of all of
                <br> the ideas I had. <br>
                <br> The scoreboard would count up whenever Two made a shot in
                <br> his basketball hoop. The IR breakbeam sensor would act as 
                <br> a pushed button to make the scoreboard count. Then, I added
                <br> the buzzer as a plus to this project so there would be sound
                <br> to celebrate when a shot was made.

            <br>I taught my bird (kind of) to drop the lego
            <br>into the hoop. The first clip is in full-speed, 
            <br> the second clip was in slow-motion, and the last
            <br>clip was just me trying to drop a bigger ball in the hoop.

            <br> Picture of my schematic & calculations. <br>
            <br> I used a 10k potentiometer for my LCD display because I am able to adjust the screen lighting
            <br> with the nob rather than switching out resistors when I want it to be brighter. For the passive 
            <br> buzzer, I realized that adding a resistor would only make it quieter and would generally take 
            <br> 16mA at 3.3V. With that said, it was reccomended in the tutorials I found to not use a resistor
            <br> and the tutorial did not have a resistor for the buzzer.
